# Budget Buddy: Expense Tracker & Visualizer

This project aims to create a simple Python program that helps you keep track of your monthly spending and manage your budget effectively.

This program allows you to enter your expenses and their categories through the terminal. It then saves this information to a file. Afterward, the program reads the file to show you how much you've spent so far in the month. It also calculates how much you have left to spend to stay within your budget for the rest of the month. Finally, it presents a visual breakdown of your expenses by category, giving you a clear picture of where your money is going.

## ðŸŽ¯ App Requirements
- Prompt the user to input an expense, including its name, category, and amount.
- Save the expense entries to a CSV file.
- Read the CSV file to summarize the total expenses for the current month.
- Calculate and display the remaining budget for the rest of the month to help the user stay within their budget.
- Save a visualization breakdown of expenses to a PNG file.
